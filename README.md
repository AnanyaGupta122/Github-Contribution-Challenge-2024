# GitHub Contribution Challenge 2024

Welcome to the GitHub Contribution Challenge Event at NIET!

This event is designed to enhance your GitHub skills while also giving you an opportunity to contribute to open source projects and compete with your peers. This README will serve as your roadmap to understand the general working of the GitHub challenge.

## Event Overview

1. **Introduction to GitHub Basics**: Before diving into the challenge, the host/coordinator will provide a brief tutorial on the basics of GitHub, covering concepts such as forking, committing, and pull requests (PRs). This will ensure that all participants are equipped with the necessary knowledge to participate effectively.

2. **Bug Fixing Challenge**: In the main phase of the event, participants will be tasked with solving bugs in files within the provided repository. The repository will contain 10 files in each of the Python and Java languages, with the difficulty increasing with each file. Each file will be assigned certain points based on its difficulty level.

3. **Scoring System**: Participants will earn points based on the difficulty level of the files they successfully fix. The leaderboard will be shared in the WhatsApp Group in a few days after the event.

4. **Submission Process**: To participate, each participant must fork the repository, fix the bugs in the designated files, and submit a pull request (PR) for each fix. PRs will not be merged by the author of the repository to avoid conflicts between files.

## Repository Structure

- The repository will contain separate directories for Python and Java files.
- Each directory will consist of 10 files, numbered from 1 to 10, representing increasing difficulty levels.
- Participants are required to fix bugs in these files and submit separate PRs for each fix.

## Scoring Details

- Each successfully fixed file will earn the participant a certain number of points based on its difficulty level.
- The participant with the highest number of points at the end of the event will be declared the winner.

## Rules and Guidelines

- Participants must adhere to the rules and guidelines provided by the host/coordinator throughout the event.
- Participants are encouraged to collaborate and help each other, but each participant must submit their own fixes via separate PRs.
- Code quality, clarity, and correctness will be taken into consideration during the evaluation process.
- Any attempts at cheating or plagiarism will result in disqualification from the event.

## How to Participate

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Identify and fix bugs in the designated files within the repository.
4. Commit your fixes and push them to your forked repository.
5. Submit separate pull requests (PRs) for each fixed file.
