# GitHub Contribution Challenge 2024

Welcome to the GitHub Contribution Challenge Event at NIET!

This event is designed to enhance your GitHub skills while also giving you an opportunity to contribute to open source projects and compete with your peers. This README will serve as your roadmap to understand the general working of the GitHub challenge.

## Event Overview

1. **Introduction to GitHub Basics**: Before diving into the challenge, the host/coordinator will provide a brief tutorial on the basics of GitHub, covering concepts such as forking, committing, and pull requests (PRs). This will ensure that all participants are equipped with the necessary knowledge to participate effectively.

2. **Bug Fixing Challenge**: In the main phase of the event, participants will be tasked with solving bugs in files within the provided repository. The repository will contain 10 files in each of the Python and Java languages, with the difficulty increasing with each file. Each file will be assigned certain points based on its difficulty level.

3. **Scoring System**: Participants will earn points based on the difficulty level of the files they successfully fix. The leaderboard will be shared in the WhatsApp Group in a few days after the event.

4. **Submission Process**: To participate, each participant must fork the repository, fix the bugs in the designated files, and submit a pull request (PR) for each fix. PRs will not be merged by the author of the repository to avoid conflicts between files.
